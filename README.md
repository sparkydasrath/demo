# Portfolio Repo

I did not want to make separate repos for all the projects. My learning has been centered around all the topics in here so wanted to keep it all centralized.

The projects described below are the 'final' versions (for demo purposes) achieved over an iterative process. See the additional links for the related started/iterated projects.

**[See Mobile Repo](https://github.com/sparkydasrath/mobile)**

**[See ALL webdev related repo](https://github.com/sparkydasrath/webdev)**

1. [Flutter Crypto Compare](https://github.com/sparkydasrath/demo/tree/master/mobile/crypto_compare_v2) - This is a Dart + Flutter mobile app that displays some available data on some crypto coins and associated currencies. You can do a pull-to-refresh to get the latest. The idea to do this spawned from 2 below. 

2. [Electron Crypto Compare](https://github.com/sparkydasrath/demo/tree/master/web/electron_cryptoCompare) - Project to combine several technologies into a single demo: Electron, Typescript, React, HTML5/CSS3, Webpack. [See Electron Projects](https://github.com/sparkydasrath/webdev/tree/master/electron)

3. [Todo](https://github.com/sparkydasrath/demo/tree/master/web/todo) - Canonical Todo app to summarize picking up Javascript, HTML5, CSS3. [See Todo Projects](https://github.com/sparkydasrath/webdev/tree/master/todo)

4. [Calculator](https://github.com/sparkydasrath/demo/tree/master/web/calculator) - Similar to the Todo in 3, this app was designed to mirror the Windows 10 desktop calculator - including a bit of Microsoft's Fluent Design reveal effect. This is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) guide.

5. [Websites](https://github.com/sparkydasrath/demo/tree/master/web/websites) (Mint, Apple (older version)) - These are non-functioning sites for the lessons in the HTML & CSS part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).
